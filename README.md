## Objective

The objective of the Enterprise Expense Fraud Detection System is to automatically detect and flag suspicious or fraudulent expense claims, reducing manual review efforts while ensuring compliance with company policies. This improves efficiency and transparency in expense management.

## Problem Statement

Manual reviews of expense claims are time-consuming and prone to errors, posing a major challenge for companies in identifying fraudulent claims. This leads to inefficiencies, delays in processing legitimate claims, and financial losses. An automated system is needed to reduce fraud risks, streamline the review process, and accurately identify suspicious spending.

## Description

The Enterprise Expense Fraud Detection System project aims to help businesses automatically identify potentially fraudulent expense claims. By analyzing expense reports for unusual patterns or policy violations, finance teams can detect potential fraud. This system accelerates the approval process, enhances the accuracy of fraud detection, and reduces the manual effort required to review each claim.
